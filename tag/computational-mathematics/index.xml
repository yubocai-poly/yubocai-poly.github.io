      <description>&lt;p&gt;This research project is under the supervision of Professor Olivier about his new method and algorithms in the numerical solution of time-fractional diffusion equation. Our overall thinking is based on these two papers: &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14146&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;paper1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/communications-in-computational-physics/article/abs/fast-evaluation-of-the-caputo-fractional-derivative-and-its-applications-to-fractional-diffusion-equations/AF5FDC74FD7A010ED0ACD291BB1A92B1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;paper2&lt;/a&gt;. Professor has already accomplished the algorithms in paper1 with a complexity of $O(N_{T}N_{S})$ and has been tested in multiple dimensions in C++. However, the paper2 came up an new algorithms with higher effiency and complexity. The algorithms is accomplished in Matlab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\partial_t u(x, t)-\nabla \cdot\left(\partial_t^{1-\alpha} \kappa_\alpha \nabla u-\boldsymbol{F} \partial_t^{1-\alpha} u\right)(x, t)=f(x, t), \quad \text { for } x \in \Omega \text { and } 0&amp;lt;t&amp;lt;T
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My job was about the topics of optimization of the computing algorithms of the time-fractional diffusion equation. My work was based on the newly proposed more efficient Caputo fractional derivative numerical method for a time-fractional equation using Matlab to implement the algorithm in one and two dimensions. And I convert the Matlab code to C++, integrate it with the original code of the second-order accurate scheme algorithms, and test it. This work has succeeded in reducing the complexity of the code from $O(N_{T}^{2}N_{S})$ to $O(N_{S} \cdot logN_{T})O(\log^{2}N_{T})$ in dimensions 1 and 2 and significantly reduces the space complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, due to certain reason and time restriction of the project. We only accomplished the code transfer and we trying to improve our merged algorithms in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also very curious about the application of this algorithm in the field of financial mathematics and quantitative finance. Many option-related models ultimately boil down to a diffusion equation, which is a partial differential equation. So the two algorithms have a high similarity, for example, by the two numerical methods Monte Carlo or finite differnece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diffusion Equation:
$$
\frac{\partial \phi(\mathbf{r}, t)}{\partial t}=\nabla \cdot[D(\phi, \mathbf{r}) \nabla \phi(\mathbf{r}, t)]
$$
Spatial derivatives are replaced by finite differences:
$$
\frac{d f}{d x} \rightarrow \frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x-\Delta x)}{2 \Delta x} .
$$
Similarly for time derivatives:
$$
\frac{d Q}{d t} \rightarrow \frac{Q^{n+1}-Q^{n-1}}{2 \Delta t}=F^n
$$
This can immediately be solved for $Q^{n+1}$ :
$$
Q^{n+1}=Q^{n-1} \cdot 2\Delta t F^{n}
$$
Ito&amp;rsquo;s lemma: If there is a Wiener process $X$ and a normally distributed increment $dX$ with mean 0 and variance $dt$, then the function $F(X)$ of the increment can be expressed by a Taylor second-order expansion as
$$
d F=\frac{d F}{d X} d X+\frac{1}{2} \frac{d^2 F}{d X^2} d t
$$
More strictly,
$$
d f\left(t, X_t\right)=\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}+\mu_t \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+\frac{\sigma_t^2}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}\right) d t+\sigma_t \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} d B_t .
$$&lt;/p&gt;
