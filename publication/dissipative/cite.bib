abstract="Quadratization refers to a transformation of an arbitrary system of polynomial ordinary differential equations to a system with at most quadratic right-hand side. Such a transformation unveils new variables and model structures that facilitate model analysis, simulation, and control and offer a convenient parameterization for data-driven approaches. Quadratization techniques have found applications in diverse fields, including systems theory, fluid mechanics, chemical reaction modeling, and mathematical analysis.",
