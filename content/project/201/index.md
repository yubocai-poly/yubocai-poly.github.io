## Abstract
This work is originally from the Homework of the abstract algebra course at Ecole Polytechnique for **MAA201-Reduction of Endomorphisms**. And I spend this work on this project.

In the first part you can see some rigorous proof of **Gauss’s Lemma** and **Eisenstein’s Criterion**, and some application in the analysis of the reducibility of the monic polynomials.

And in the second part, we will see the proof of **Frobenius Reduction** which in French is **Decomposition de Frobenius**. Since there is no really detailed proof of this in English so here you can find the Lemma and proof relatively in order to prove this theorem.
