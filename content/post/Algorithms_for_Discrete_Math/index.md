## Introduction

This is the advanced course of MAA103-Discrete Mathematics and we trying to use programming to apply some algorithms in discrete mathematics.

### Reference
Here is a great textbook (available at Polytechnique's library) that covers the 3 lectures: [Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science. R.Graham, D.E.Knuth, O.Patashnik](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~r97002/temp/Concrete%20Mathematics%202e.pdf).

However, this book is too broad. If you want to get to know this course more quickly. Here you can access the [github repository](https://github.com/yubocai-poly/Algorithms-for-Discrete-Mathematics), where the course is consist of Tutorial in Jupyter Notebook and Lecture. For lecture information you can find my lecture notes token from courses for each chapter from the link above.
