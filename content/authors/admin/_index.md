Hi, welcome to Yubo Cai's personal website. I am currently a bachelor student at Ecole Polytechnique double major in applied mathematics and computer sciences. This summer I was working on a project at INRIA on the topics of optimization of the computing algorithms of the time-fractional diffusion equation. I was working on the transformation of Matlab code to C++ code and applying the algorithms on the approximation of functions by exponential sums with C++ to improve the complexity of the algorithms from $O(N_{T}^{2}N_{S})$ to $O(N_{S} \cdot logN_{T})O(\log^{2}N_{T})$.

I am currently looking for summer research internship in Computational Mathematics, Operation Research in Optimization and Machine Learning. Also I am open to Part-time RA positions.
