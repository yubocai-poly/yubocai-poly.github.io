Courses MAA201 - Reduction of Endomorphisms (Abstract Algebra)  Introduction: In this course we will introduce the basic concepts in abstract algebra.  Basic notions of groups, rings and their ideals, commutative fields (3 weeks) arithmetics of the set of integers, ideals of the set of integers (2 weeks) Basic notions of polynomials, Euclidean division (d’Alembert-Gauss fundamental theorem of algebra is admitted) (2 weeks) Basic matrix reduction: eigenvalues, eigenspaces, characteristic polynomial, diagonalization and trigonalization (4 weeks) Advanced matrix reduction: minimal polynomial, the kernel lemma, characteristic spaces, Cayley-Hamilton theorem, Dunford reduction of a matrix. No Jordan reduction (3 weeks)   Reference: Here is the course page of Algèbre et arithmétique from Sorbonne University second year course. The textbook in this courses in really detailed in explaination and information, also more organized. You can also find some TD in the course page but however is much easier than the Exercise at l’X.  MAA202 - Topology and Multivariables Calculus  Introduction: The goal of this course is to extend notions of analysis in $\\mathbf{R}$, $\\mathbf{C}$ and of calculus in $\\mathbf{R}$ seen in the first year (mainly in MAA102 and MAA105) to notions of analysis in normed vector spaces and of calculus in $\\mathbf{R}^d$, $d\\in \\mathbf{N}$. Throughout the semester we will discuss the following topics:  topology, convergence of sequences, continuity and compactness; important properties concerning the particular case of finite dimensional vector spaces, differentiability in finite dimensional vector spaces and tools to compute the extrema of functions of several variables, some notions of integrals of functions of several variables.   Reference:  MAA203 - Introduction to Statistics  Introduction: This is the introduction course of probability and statistics at Ecole Polytechnique. In bachelor program of Ecole Polytechnique, you will learn statistics later after this course and in third year you will learn about Asymptotic Statistics provided by Prof. E. Moulines and Stochastic Processes by Prof. T. Mastrolia. You can find some important information and material which is helpful for this course. Chapters: Here are the chapters of this course.  Chapter 1 - Discrete Probability Spaces: In this chapter, you will know the definition and basic concept of DPS, also we will introduce some combinatorial calculus and conditioning, independence those baisc knowledge in Probability. Chapter 2 - Random Variables: The main content of this chapter is about some basic concepts of RV in DPS, such as Joint densites and marginal densitis, expecation, Variance, Covariance, PDF, CDF, MGF of the random variable. Also we will try to see $L^{P}$ spaces this concept in this chapter. Chapter 3 - General Probability spaces adn random variables: Since in the last chapter we only discuss the situation in DPS. In this chapter we will expend those concepts into absolution continuous random variables. Chapter 4 - Convergence of random variables and law of large numbers: For the last chapter, we will introduce different types convergence for absolute continuous variable and learn about laws of large numbers. Also we will talk a little bit about Monte carlo methods at the end of the courses.   Reference: The professor of this course is the worst that I ever seen in l’X. So I collected some material that might be helpful. The first note in written by me which contains most important definition and proposition of the course. Also I add some extra important points or conclusion I learned while I do the TD and cheat sheet of Expectatioin, variance, CDF, PDF, MGF of common distributions. You can find the notes from this link. Also, I have some recommendation of material for this course. You can find 概率论与数理统计（浙大第四版) and A First Course in Prabability by Sheldon Ross. All of them are really classical textbook for probability. However, MAA203 in l’X is really theoretical and you have to prove a lot basic definition or proposition in thie course. Also, you can find this Textbook from X-HEC DSBA program by Lucas Gerin who is also our professor for MAA205-Algorithms for Discrete Mathematics. And here is my notes which collected all the basic concepts and important proposition from courses and exercises and a collection of concepts in probability and statistics from Harvard University which is really useful.

Then in the second part of the project, we gonna discuss options in different time periods and give the general case with more details.\nAt the end of the project, we give another expression and our conclusion and remarks.\n General assumptions and underlying models To begin with, we assume that all the financial assets in our problem can be infinitely divided. Also, we regard that they can be sold even if the agent does not have them. That is, we can own actually negative units of a certain financial asset. In our project, we will always consider a simple financial market that only contains the following three types of financial assets:\n  Non-risky products (savings in particular) with an interest $r$.\n  Risky products (stocks in particular) which evolves randomly with respect to time. We can model the price of stocks (denoted by S) in the following way. Assume at each step, the price will either be multiplied by a scalar u ($ u \\geq 1$), or be multiplied by another scalar d ($d \\leq 1$). To note that this process is assumed to be perfectly fair. That is to say, the price will either go through a fixed rising process or a fixed decreasing process and the probability of which is equal. We denote the rising process as H and the decreasing process as T and use them to manifest the index of the price. For instance, if the price first went up, then went down for successively two times, we can denote the index as (H, T, T). The figure below gives a more complete example. We will denote $\\Omega$ as the set of all the possible indices at the last stage involved in the process. We have: $$ \\Omega=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\{H H, H T, T H, T T\\}, \\text { after two steps } \\\\ \\{H H H, H H T, H T H, H T T, T H H, T H T, T T H, T T T\\}, \\text { after three steps } \\end{array}\\right. $$ If $\\omega$ is an element of $\\Omega$, we will denote $\\omega_{k}$ as the $k^{th}$ component of $\\omega$. The price of the stock with all the possible outcomes up to two steps with $S_0=4$, $u=2$ and $d=\\frac{1}{2}$ is given below: Here $S_n(\\omega)=p \\times S_{n-1}(\\omega-\\omega_n)$, where $p=2$ if ${\\omega_n}=H$ and $p=\\frac{1}{2}$ if ${\\omega_n}=T$.\n  Another risky product: option.\nWe will consider a European option, which is, by definition, a version of an options contract that limits execution to its expiration date. In other words, if the underlying security has moved in price, an investor would not be able to exercise the option early and take delivery of or sell the shares. If the strike price of an option is denoted by K and the expiration is n years, our final payoff of such a call option denoted by $V_{n}$ will satisfy that $V_{n}(\\omega) = max{0, S_{n}(\\omega)-K}$. Indeed, under an index $\\omega$ of the stock price, if the price is higher than the strike price, we will sell the stocks and get some money, if the price is lower than the strike price, the best choice is obviously to do nothing as one will lose money otherwise.\n   Copyright Copyright by Yubo Cai, Tianli Xu, Zhuoya Zhang\n","date":1670112000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670112000,"objectID":"b4bc223214264cec95410c6a02ab0c14","permalink":"https://example.com/project/107/","publishdate":"2022-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/107/","section":"project","summary":"MAA107 Mathematical Modeling Final Project.","tags":["Financial Mathematics"],"title":"Pricing an option with binomial models","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"CSE104 is the courses held by Professor Rohmer Damien at Ecole Polytechnique.

Lossy compression algorithms allow to greatly reduce the size of image files at the price of loosing some data from the original image. In general, a lossy image compression works by pruning the information the human eye is not sensible to. This is the case, for instance, in the JPEG file format.\nThe JPEG compression algorithm can be decomposed into several steps:\n  In theory, JPEG-based compression schemes are independent of the image color-space (e.g. Red-Green-Blue). However the best rates of compression are obtained in a color space that separates the light-intensity (luminance) from the color information (chrominance). Indeed, the human eye is quite sensitive to luminance but little to chrominance and we can then afford to lose more chrominance information.\n  Hence, the algorithm starts by converting the original image from its initial RGB (Red-Green-Blue) colorimetric model towards the YCbCr model of type luminance/chrominance. In this model, Y is the information of luminance, and Cb and Cr give chrominance values, respectively the blue minus Y and the red minus Y.\n  This low sensitivity of the human eye to chrominance is exploited by performing a subsampling of the color signals. The principle of the operation is to reduce the size of several blocks of chrominance in a single value.\n  The image is then split into blocks of 8×8 subpixels.\n  A 2D DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) is then applied to each block. The DCT is a variant of the Fourier transform. It decomposes a block, considered as a function in two variables, into a sum of cosine functions. Each block is thus described in a map of frequencies and amplitudes rather than in pixels and color information.\n  Then, a quantization step takes place. The quantization consists in dividing the DCT matrix by another one, called quantization matrix. The goal here is to attenuate the high frequencies, i.e. those to which the human eye is very insensitive. These frequencies have low amplitudes, and they are further attenuated by quantization (some coefficients are even often reduced to 0).\n  Finally, each block is coded using a variation of the Run-length encoding associated with an arithmetic coding – both are lossless data compression algorithm.\n  Project Schedule The goal of this project is to write a JPEG-like image encoder/decoder. This is a 3-week project:\n  during the first week, we will focus on:\n loading / saving image files, converting images between the RGB \u0026amp; the YCbCr color space, and performing channels subsampling.    during the second week, we will focus on the DCT transform, and\n  during the third week, we will consider the RLE \u0026amp; arithmetic coding.\n  Professors  Pierre-Yves Strub  Contributors  Yubo Cai  Tools of this course VScode, Python, Numpy, matplotlib, mathematical analysis\nIn this project, you need some basic knowledge about Linear Algebra like Matrix multplication and Fouier Transformation.

Professor has already accomplished the algorithms in paper1 with a complexity of $O(N_{T}N_{S})$ and has been tested in multiple dimensions in C++. However, the paper2 came up an new algorithms with higher effiency and complexity.

My work was based on the newly proposed more efficient Caputo fractional derivative numerical method for a time-fractional equation using Matlab to implement the algorithm in one and two dimensions. And I convert the Matlab code to C++, integrate it with the original code of the second-order accurate scheme algorithms, and test it. This work has succeeded in reducing the complexity of the code from $O(N_{T}^{2}N_{S})$ to $O(N_{S} \\cdot logN_{T})O(\\log^{2}N_{T})$ in dimensions 1 and 2 and significantly reduces the space complexity.\nHowever, due to certain reason and time restriction of the project. We only accomplished the code transfer and we trying to improve our merged algorithms in the future.\nWe are also very curious about the application of this algorithm in the field of financial mathematics and quantitative finance. Many option-related models ultimately boil down to a diffusion equation, which is a partial differential equation.
