Lossy compression algorithms allow to greatly reduce the size of image files at the price of loosing some data from the original image. In general, a lossy image compression works by pruning the information the human eye is not sensible to. This is the case, for instance, in the JPEG file format.\nThe JPEG compression algorithm can be decomposed into several steps:\n  In theory, JPEG-based compression schemes are independent of the image color-space (e.g. Red-Green-Blue). However the best rates of compression are obtained in a color space that separates the light-intensity (luminance) from the color information (chrominance). Indeed, the human eye is quite sensitive to luminance but little to chrominance and we can then afford to lose more chrominance information.\n  Hence, the algorithm starts by converting the original image from its initial RGB (Red-Green-Blue) colorimetric model towards the YCbCr model of type luminance/chrominance. In this model, Y is the information of luminance, and Cb and Cr give chrominance values, respectively the blue minus Y and the red minus Y.\n  This low sensitivity of the human eye to chrominance is exploited by performing a subsampling of the color signals. The principle of the operation is to reduce the size of several blocks of chrominance in a single value.\n  The image is then split into blocks of 8×8 subpixels.\n  A 2D DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) is then applied to each block. The DCT is a variant of the Fourier transform. It decomposes a block, considered as a function in two variables, into a sum of cosine functions. Each block is thus described in a map of frequencies and amplitudes rather than in pixels and color information.\n  Then, a quantization step takes place. The quantization consists in dividing the DCT matrix by another one, called quantization matrix. The goal here is to attenuate the high frequencies, i.e. those to which the human eye is very insensitive. These frequencies have low amplitudes, and they are further attenuated by quantization (some coefficients are even often reduced to 0).\n  Finally, each block is coded using a variation of the Run-length encoding associated with an arithmetic coding – both are lossless data compression algorithm.\n  Project Schedule The goal of this project is to write a JPEG-like image encoder/decoder. This is a 3-week project:\n  during the first week, we will focus on:\n loading / saving image files, converting images between the RGB \u0026amp; the YCbCr color space, and performing channels subsampling.    during the second week, we will focus on the DCT transform, and\n  during the third week, we will consider the RLE \u0026amp; arithmetic coding.\n  Professors  Pierre-Yves Strub  Contributors  Yubo Cai  Tools of this course VScode, Python, Numpy, matplotlib, mathematical analysis\nIn this project, you need some basic knowledge about Linear Algebra like Matrix multplication and Fouier Transformation.

This work has succeeded in reducing the complexity of the code from $O(N_{T}N_{S})$ to $O(N_{S} \\cdot logN_{T})$ in dimensions 1 and 2 and significantly reduces the space complexity.\nHowever, due to certain reason and time restriction of the project.

Chapter  Chapter 1 - Discrete Probability Spaces: In this chapter, you will know the definition and basic concept of DPS, also we will introduce some combinatorial calculus and conditioning, independence those baisc knowledge in Probability. Chapter 2 - Random Variables: The main content of this chapter is about some basic concepts of RV in DPS, such as Joint densites and marginal densitis, expecation, Variance, Covariance, PDF, CDF, MGF of the random variable. Also we will try to see $L^{P}$ spaces this concept in this chapter. Chapter 3 - General Probability spaces adn random variables: Since in the last chapter we only discuss the situation in DPS. In this chapter we will expend those concepts into absolution continuous random variables. Chapter 4 - Convergence of random variables and law of large numbers: For the last chapter, we will introduce different types convergence for absolute continuous variable and learn about laws of large numbers. Also we will talk a little bit about Monte carlo methods at the end of the courses.  Extra Reference and Material The professor of this course is the worst that I ever seen in l’X. So I collected some material that might be helpful. The first note in written by me which contains most important definition and proposition of the course. Also I add some extra important points or conclusion I learned while I do the TD and cheat sheet of Expectatioin, variance, CDF, PDF, MGF of common distributions. You can find the notes from this link.\nAlso, I have some recommendation of material for this course. You can find 概率论与数理统计（浙大第四版) and A First Course in Prabability by Sheldon Ross. All of them are really classical textbook for probability. However, MAA203 in l’X is really theoretical and you have to prove a lot basic definition or proposition in thie course.
